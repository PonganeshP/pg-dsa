## Daily Study Approach (1-1.5 hours)
1. Review previous session's notes (5-10 minutes)
2. Study new material or work on exercises (40-60 minutes)
3. Summarize key learnings and prepare questions for next session (10-15 minutes)

Remember to adjust the pace as needed and focus on understanding concepts rather than rushing through the material.
