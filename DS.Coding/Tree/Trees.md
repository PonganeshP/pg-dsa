***Properties to remember:***
- **Degree** - Number of children of a node
- Depth - can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node
- If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges

*Applications:* Data compression, Compiler design, Indexing, File system

*pros:*
	  AVL tree best for searching - O(log n)
*cons:*
	Trees demand **more memory space requirements**

**Need For Interview:**
Should be very familiar with writing pre-order, in-order, and post-order [[Tree Traversal]] recursively.

###### Problem Solving
- [[Max Depth or Height of Binary tree]]
- [[Same Tree]]
